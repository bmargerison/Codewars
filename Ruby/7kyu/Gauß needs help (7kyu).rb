Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young 
GauÃŸ, Herr J.G. BÃ¼ttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl 
Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his 
mates, assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 
through a given number n.

Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly 
as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

Here's, an example:

f(n=100) // returns 5050 

It's your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. If not, 
please, return false (None for Python, null for C#).

#my solution
def f(n=false)
  n.is_a?(Integer) ? n >= 1 ? (1..n).reduce(:+) : false : false
end
  
#best solution
#I did consider using just one if statement but thought I would get an error if 
#I passed a non-integer to "n > 0"

def f(n=false)
  (n.kind_of?(Integer) && n > 0) ? (n+1) * n /2 : false
end
